## Introduction
This is a chess AI that uses alpha-beta pruning on a decision tree to determine the best move. It is written in Python. You can play player vs player as chess is built in, or you can play against the AI.

## How to Play
To play run:

```python (or python3) endurance.py```

From there it will ask if you want to player 2-player or vs the ai (named TARS).

## Note
You can specify the depth of the tree to regulate performance by going into the globals file and changing the DEPTH variable. The default is 3.
